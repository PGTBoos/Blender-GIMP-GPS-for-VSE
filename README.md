# Blender-GIMP-GPS-for-VSE  
Every year I make my vacation video / photo - slide show using Blender.  
This addon is for Bledner 5.x.x  (currently 5.0.1)  
It is handy for vacation slideshows, quickly see where a photo was taken, or open a photo in gimp to correct it.  

> If you correct a photo Blender using GIMP.  
> Blender might not be aware of the update, after saving in Gimp.   
> After saving as the original file in Gimp.  
> Just delete and undelete on the VSE strip, it then updates.    

It will try to use gimp by default install locations, if yours is different. Then just edit the path code for gimp in the addon.
